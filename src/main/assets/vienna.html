        Until the beginning of the 20th century, Vienna was the largest German-speaking city
        in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I,
        the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it is the second-largest German-speaking 
        city after Berlin.
